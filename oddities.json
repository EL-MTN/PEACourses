As, these forms of Western thinking spread throughout, the globe on the waves of imperialism, Europeans, encountered practices of indigenous cultures that, they classified as taboo or dangerous.

Among the topics, considered are the relationship of institutional, power to societal beliefs in the supernatural;, social constructions of purity, taboo and danger;, gender roles and behavioral norms; categories of, magic; curative practices; and the categorization, of \"madness\" or mental disorders.

Where earlier historians attribute, this development to white immigrants and creative, inventors in the North, we will explore the ways, that  slave trading entrepreneurs and their ever, more brutal and cruelly efficient systems of slave, labor were just as essential to the story of, America's rise as an economic and imperial, powerhouse. While northern factories depended on a, pool of labor from Europe, Southern planters, achieved a mobile supply of labor by ripping, families apart.  Southern enslavers engaged in, technical innovations, economies of scale, and new, methods of financing their operations.  It was in, the South, not in the North, for example, that a, modern banking system emerged, underwritten by, investments in the bodies of human beings., Students in this course will reexamine slavery to, reconstruct the American economic development, through studying quantitative, and statistical, data.
