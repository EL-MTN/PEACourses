What is worth the, most time, effort and resources? What are our, obligations to each other and other organisms on, which we depend? Who is responsible for the, outcomes of the science, to whom and for what? Is, there a moral question here, and how should we, respond? The study of bioethics is, multidisciplinary. It integrates ideas from, theology, history, philosophy and law with modern, medicine, health-care and biological research., This is a team-taught course given by a religion, teacher and biology teacher that will dive into, these significant questions that are as basic as, the meaning of life, when does it really begin, and end, how do we attenuate the pain and, suffering of other beings and what are our rights, and the responsibility that comes with those, rights.

But have we consciously and, adequately considered the drawbacks, or have we, unwittingly paid for convenience with the erosion, of fundamental values such as free speech, privacy, democratic values, personal reflection, and the nature and depth of relationships? In what, ways have the traditional systems and modes of, interaction in communications, the media, education, medicine, the traditional economy, even, the basic operations of democracy itself, been, challenged by these new technologies, and to what, extent have we understood the ethical consequences, of such challenges? Using specific case studies, drawn from the vast and complicated world of, technology, this course will assist the student in, identifying the various ethical issues embedded in, the world of technology and to develop strategies, to deal with them. Readings will include many, actual case studies plus articles and books, which, are themselves case studies. An integral part of, the course will have each student paired, electronically with an Exeter alumnus/a working in, a technology company who will help them identify, and research an issue germane to the course, with, students as a final project writing their own case, study about ethics in technology.",

The first and, second laws of thermodynamics will be explored;, the fundamental equations of thermodynamics, as, differential equations, will be used to define the, properties of temperature, pressure and chemical, potential; and the concept of free energy (and its, importance in describing equilibrium) will be, developed.
